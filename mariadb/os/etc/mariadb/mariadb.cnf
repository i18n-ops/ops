# The MariaDB configuration file
#
# The MariaDB/MySQL tools read configuration files in the following order:
# 0. "/etc/mariadb/my.cnf" symlinks to this file, reason why all the rest is read.
# 1. "/etc/mariadb/mariadb.cnf" (this file) to set global defaults,
# 2. "/etc/mariadb/conf.d/*.cnf" to set global options.
# 3. "/etc/mariadb/mariadb.conf.d/*.cnf" to set MariaDB-only options.
# 4. "~/.my.cnf" to set user-specific options.
#
# If the same option is defined multiple times, the last one will apply.
#
# One can use all long options that the program supports.
# Run program with --help to get a list of available options and with
# --print-defaults to see which it would actually understand and use.
